# OlivierFest-Agda

The Agda code provides a lightweight formalization of the denotational semantics
of the language ScmQE defined in the paper:

> Peter D. Mosses. 2025. A Compositional Semantics for `eval` in Scheme.
> In *Proceedings of the Workshop Dedicated to Olivier Danvy*
> *on the Occasion of His 64th Birthday (OLIVIERFEST ’25),*
> *October 12–18, 2025, Singapore, Singapore.*
> ACM, New York, NY, USA, 10 pages. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1145/3759427.3760369)

The relationship of the formalization to the definitions in the paper is explained
in §6 of the paper.
