% and for loading further packages, defining Unicode characters, etc.

\renewcommand{\AgdaSymbol}[1]
  {\AgdaNoSpaceMath{\textcolor{AgdaSymbol}{\AgdaFontStyle{\AgdaFormat{#1}{#1}}}}}

% Typeset -> as \to, and \ as \lambda:

\DeclareRobustCommand{\AgdaFormat}[2]{%
  \ifthenelse{\equal{#1}{->}}{\ensuremath\to}{%
     \ifthenelse{\equal{#1}{\textbackslash{}}}{\ensuremath\lambda}{%
      #2}}}
