%% The abstract is a short summary of the work to be presented in the
%% article.
\begin{abstract}

\textsc{Scm} is a simple sublanguage of \textsc{Scheme};
\textsc{ScmQ} adds quotations to \textsc{Scm}; and
\textsc{ScmQE} adds \emph{eval} expressions to \textsc{ScmQ}.

An accompanying paper presents a denotational semantics of \textsc{Scm}
and the additions and changes in the semantics of \textsc{ScmQ} and \textsc{ScmQE}.
This document lists a lightweight \textsc{Agda} formalization of the complete denotational semantics of \textsc{ScmQE}.
For explanatory comments, see the accompanying paper.

\textsc{Agda} generated the \LaTeX\ sources for the highlighted listing;
a map from \textsc{Unicode} characters to similar-looking math symbols was manually coded.
The \LaTeX\ sources for the illustrative fragments presented in the body of the accompanying paper were
copied from the \textsc{Agda}-generated sources, but may have been edited to adjust layout and alignment.

\end{abstract}

%For simplicity, \emph{eval} is here treated as a primitive syntactic form, rather than a procedure, and implicitly uses the null environment when evaluating the expression returned by its single argument.
